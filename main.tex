\begin{abstract}
From 2012-07-12 through 2012-09-04 (55 days), a magnetotelluric (MT) instrument made continuous 1-second recordings at Middelpos, a South African site. Two methods were used to compute the surface impedance transfer function (TF): (1) 55 TFs were computed and averaged using non-overlapping one-day segments, and (2) one TF was computed using the full 55-day segment. The error bars were calculated using parametric formulas that assume a known distribution of errors and a bootstrap method. A frequency--domain quality metric, the signal-to-prediction error ($\text{SE}$), was calculated to assess the quality of predictions of the electric field from the computed TFs. The computed TFs have significant off-diagonal components, suggesting a complex ground-conductivity structure. The SE is greater than one only in the range of 1-minute to 6-hours for the $E_x$--related terms and 1-minute to 1-hour for $E_y$--related terms. We also find differences in the transfer functions computed in two ways that are inconsistent with the error bars.

\section{Introduction}

The surface impedance of the Earth under a power line is an essential parameter for deriving geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) in the power line from measured or predicted geomagnetic fields. The surface impedance is also the starting point for estimating the ground conductivity structure \cite{Simpson2005}. The surface impedance links the estimated electric field to the geomagnetic field. The surface impedance is typically derived from magnetotelluric (MT) measurements, which combine co-located 3-axis magnetic field measurements with 2-axis horizontal electric field measurements (\cite{Naido2012}, \cite{Simpson2005}). The electric field (E-field) and magnetic field (B-field) are not independent of each other but are linked by a transfer function derived from Maxwell’s equations (\cite{Vozoff1991}; \cite{Simpson2005}).

MT measurements have been made in South Africa by various institutions. The SAMTEX campaign, comprising short-term ($\sim$3 weeks per location) measurements along various transects in South Africa, was conducted by a consortium of geophysicists to characterize the Kaapvaal Craton in the central part of South Africa \cite{Jones2009}. The South African National Space Agency (SANSA) deployed long-term MT measurement stations (operating for several months at each location) at seven locations to provide useful data for GIC estimation by the Space Weather Centre at SANSA (Ref. 3 – report).

Several algorithms have been used to derive the tensor components of the surface impedance. The original work of \cite{Cagniard1953} on MT data analysis assumed orthogonality of the B-- and E--field vectors, which results in a surface impedance matrix with zero off-diagonal components. \cite{Sims1971} introduced regression--based algorithms for computing all components of the impedance tensor. The LEMI software provided with the LEMI magnetometers produced by the LLC in Lviv, Ukraine (Ref), the Egbert algorithm (\cite{Egbert1997}, \cite{Egbert2011}), the Jones algorithm (\cite{Jones1989}; \cite{Chave2012}), and various others \cite{Larsen1996}.

\cite{Eggers1982} introduced the eigenstate analysis of
the impedance tensor to allow for non-orthogonality between the magnetic and electric field vectors. \cite{Bahr1988} introduced the telluric vector technique to address local telluric distortion.

Recent papers in which transfer functions were derived from MT measurements include \cite{Jones1989}, \cite{Moorkamp2007}, \cite{Fujii2015}, \cite{Heyns2020}, \cite{Weigel2019}, and \cite{Chen2021}.

\section{Data}
\label{section:Data}

Data were obtained from the LEMI-417 instrument, which is designed for long--term recording of MT data; it is comprised of a 3--axis fluxgate magnetometer and a 2--axis electric field antenna. The instrument was installed in an empty field near the small town (population $\sim$300) Middelpos, South Africa, located at geographic latitude $-31.906^\circ$ and longitude $20.234^\circ$ at an altitude of 1165~m. The instrument is powered by batteries charged by a solar panel. The instrument at Middelpos is one of eight MT instruments in southern Africa managed by the South African National Space Agency (SANSA).

The $+x$-axes of both the magnetometer and electric field probe are aligned with geomagnetic North on 2012-07-12 when the magnetic declination at Middelpos was $-23.2541323^\circ$ (computed using the IGRF model [\cite{igrf}]). Figure~\ref{fig:site} is an annotated Google Earth image of the instrument location and electric field probes. The timestamp of the measurements is derived from a GPS chip in the LEMI-417 instrument. Data were manually retrieved during a site visit by SANSA technicians.

The magnetometer is positioned $5$~m from the LEMI-417 to reduce the impact of instrument currents on its measurements.

The time series of 1--second--cadence electric, $\mathbf{E}(t)$, and magnetic, $\mathbf{B}(t)$, field measurements is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:timeseries}. Each component $k=x, y$ of $\mathbf{E}(t)$ was despiked by finding times when $|E_k(t+1)-E_k(t)|\ge 0.1$~mV/km and replacing values in the time range $[t-1, t+5]$ with linearly interpolated values based on $E_k(t-2)$ and $E_k(t+6)$. The number of spikes in $E_x(t)$ was $112$ ($0.002$\%); for $E_y(t)$, the number was $904$ ($0.02$\%).

The averaged amplitudes of the Fourier coefficients for each vector component of the time series shown in Figure~\ref{fig:timeseries}(a) are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:timeseries}(b). The averaged amplitudes shown are frequency--domain averages of the discrete Fourier transform amplitudes. The values of the band centers, marked with filled circles, the number of values in each band, and the band boundaries are given in Tables~\ref{table:evalfreqs1d} and~\ref{table:evalfreqs119d} of Appendix~\ref{appendix:tables}. The vertical bars correspond to 95\% confidence intervals; the length of the confidence interval for the magnitude of a Fourier coefficient, $\Delta|\widetilde{A}|$, calculated using propagation of errors in $|\widetilde{A}| = \sqrt{A_r^2 + A_i^2}$, is

\begin{equation}
\Delta\big|\widetilde{A}\big| = \sqrt{(A_r\Delta A_r)^2 + (A_i\Delta A_i)^2} / \big|\widetilde{A}\big|
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $\Delta A_r$ and $\Delta A_i$ are the lengths of the 95\% confidence intervals for the real ($A_r$) and imaginary ($A_i$) parts of $\widetilde{A}$, respectively; $\widetilde{A}$ is one of the $\widetilde{B}_x$, $\widetilde{B}_y$, $\widetilde{E}_x$, and $\widetilde{E}_y$, which are frequency domain averages shown in Figure~\ref{fig:timeseries}(b). The lengths of the 95\% symmetric confidence intervals for the averages $A_r$ and $A_i$ were determined using $\pm 2 (s/\sqrt{n})t^{-1}_{n-1}(0.025)$, where $n$ is the number of values used to calculate the average, $t^{-1}_{n-1}(0.025)$ is the inverse $t$-distribution evaluated at $0.025$ and $s$ is the standard deviation of the sample.

\section{Models and Methods}
\label{section:Models_and_Methods}

$\mathbf{E}(t)$ and $\mathbf{B}(t)$ measurements are used to estimate the complex--valued transfer function matrix $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{\widetilde{Z}}}$ in

\begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation}
        \mathbf{\widetilde{E}}(f_e) = \boldsymbol{\mathcal{
    \widetilde{Z}}}(f_e)\mathbf{\widetilde{B}}(f_e)\text{ ,}
    \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

\noindent where $f_e$ is an ``evaluation frequency" and

\begin{linenomath*}
    \begin{equation}
        \boldsymbol{\mathcal{\widetilde{Z}}}(f_e) = 
            \begin{bmatrix}
                \widetilde{Z}_{xx}(f_e) & \widetilde{Z}_{xy}(f_e)\\
                \widetilde{Z}_{yx}(f_e) & \widetilde{Z}_{yy}(f_e)
            \end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation}
\end{linenomath*}

\noindent using a method described by \citeay{Sims1971}: for each $\mathbf{\widetilde{E}}$ vector component $k=x,y$, a four parameter over--determined linear regression is performed using

\begin{equation}
\widetilde{E}_k(f) = \widetilde{Z}_{kx}(f)\widetilde{B}_x(f) + \widetilde{Z}_{ky}(f)\widetilde{B}_y(f)
\label{eqn:single}
\end{equation}

\noindent with values of $f$ in a band around $f_e$. (The number of parameters is four because the two regression parameters $\widetilde{Z}_{kx}$ and $\widetilde{Z}_{ky}$ in Equation~\ref{eqn:single} are complex--valued; the actual regression is performed using only real numbers -- see \cite{Egbert1986}).

Two methods have been used for computing the Fourier coefficients -- one uses the standard DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) formula for equally spaced records, typically implemented using the FFT algorithm. The other is an approximation based on the method of ``Cascade Decimation" \citep{Wight1980}, which can require less memory and produce logarithmically spaced evaluation frequencies. Here, we use the standard DFT formula because it is not an approximation.

There are two general methods for computing estimates of $\widetilde{Z}_{kx}$ and $\widetilde{Z}_{ky}$ for each evaluation frequency: (1) compute the Fourier coefficients using the full time series and then perform regression using the Fourier coefficients in a band centered on the evaluation frequency and (2) split the full time series into (possibly overlapping) segments, perform a regression on each segment using the Fourier coefficients in a band centered on the evaluation frequency to find segment estimates of $\widetilde{Z}_{kx}$ and $\widetilde{Z}_{ky}$, and then average the segment estimates of $\widetilde{Z}_{kx}$ and $\widetilde{Z}_{ky}$. In this paper, we present results from both methods; for the second method, non--overlapping time series segments were used, and the estimates of $\widetilde{Z}_{kx}$ and $\widetilde{Z}_{ky}$ are unweighted averages. 

There are two common modifications to these estimation methods. The first is the ``remote reference"  method, which uses $\mathbf{B}(t)$ measurements covering the same time interval from a nearby magnetometer~\citep{Simpson2005}. In our case, we do not have such data. The second uses a robust algorithm for regression, which involves computing estimates of $\widetilde{Z}_{kx}$ and $\widetilde{Z}_{ky}$ using a custom error function instead of the standard sum--of--squares error function (\cite{Simpson2005}; see also~\cite{Thomson2016} for a discussion about the ``overselling'' of this method). The custom error function automatically downweights outliers. For the data considered, we have found that this method produces differing results only at evaluation frequencies where the signal-to-prediction error is less than 1.0.

\section{Results}
\label{section:Results}

Figure~\ref{fig:z} shows the results of the regression described in Section~\ref{section:Models_and_Methods}. For the components of $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{\widetilde{Z}}}$ computed using one $55$--day segment, 95\% confidence intervals were computed using formulas that assume the regression errors are independent and identically distributed (\cite{Draper1981}; chapter 2.6). For the magnitudes calculated using the average of $55$ one--day segments, the 95\% confidence intervals were calculated using the formula given in Section~\ref{section:Data} for the magnitudes of the DFT amplitudes. The error bars for the phases were calculated using propagation of errors on

$$\phi_{ij}=\tan^{-1}[\text{Im}(\widetilde{Z}_{ij})/\text{Re}(\widetilde{Z}_{ij})]$$

\noindent giving

$$\Delta\phi_{ij} = (1/|\widetilde{Z}_{ij}|^2) \sqrt{ \big[\text{Im}(\widetilde{Z}_{ij})\text{Re}(\Delta \widetilde{Z}_{ij})\big]^2 + \big[\text{Re}(\widetilde{Z}_{ij})\text{Im}(\Delta \widetilde{Z}_{ij}) \big]^2}.$$

\noindent where $\Delta \widetilde{Z}_{ij}$ is the 95\% confidence interval length for element $\widetilde{Z}_{ij}$ of $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{\widetilde{Z}}}$, $|\boldsymbol{\cdotp}|$ is the complex magnitude, and $\text{Re}(\boldsymbol{\cdotp})$ and $\text{Im}(\boldsymbol{\cdotp})$ are the real and imaginary parts of the argument, respectively.

A key result is that there are significant differences in the transfer functions computed using the two approaches. We have verified that the two approaches should give transfer functions without statistically significant differences by generating a simulated $\mathbf{E}(t)$ by convolving a white noise $\mathbf{B}(t)$ with idealized transfer functions (the two approaches will not give identical transfer functions due to the differences in frequency grids, but the average transfer functions from the two approaches will converge). As a result, we conclude that the observed differences are likely due to non-stationarity.

In the literature, many results are presented using only one algorithm and a single set of parameters for that algorithm. However, it seems that, given that these two reasonable approaches for computing a transfer function can yield different results, there is an ``algorithmic uncertainty" that should be accounted for by computing the transfer function using different algorithms and varying parameter values for a given algorithm. There is also an uncertainty due to the data selection; \cite{Chen2022} noted that for some SAMTEX sites, the transfer functions were dependent on the time intervals used in their computation, in particular on whether the interval contained a period of high geomagnetic activity. This is expected because the plane wave approximation is invalid when geomagnetic activity is strong. Conversely, in the limit of low geomagnetic activity, the signal-to-noise ratio is low, leading to large error bars in the computed transfer functions. 

The signal--to--error ratio, $\text{SE}_k(f_e)$, for component $k=x,y$ of $\mathbf{E}$ was calculated using 

\begin{equation}
\text{SE}_k(f_e) = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^{N_e} \left|\widetilde{E}_k(f_j)\right|^2}{\displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^{N_e}\left|\Delta\widetilde{E}_k(f_j)\right|^2}
\label{eqn:se}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $j$ is the index of the DFT frequency in the band centered on $f_e=1/T_e$; Tables~\ref{table:evalfreqs1d} and~\ref{table:evalfreqs119d} in Appendix~\ref{appendix:tables} list the band centers, ranges, and number of frequencies, $N_e$ in each band for each regression method. The error, $\Delta\widetilde{E}_k = \widetilde{E}_k^{\text{p}}-\widetilde{E}_k$, is the difference between the complex--valued DFT amplitudes of the predicted, $E_k^\text{p}(t)$, and measured, $E_k(t)$, signals after convolution with a Parzen window. The predicted signal, $E_k^{\text{p}}$, was computed by linearly interpolating the real and imaginary parts of $\widetilde{Z}_{kx}$ and $\widetilde{Z}_{ky}$ onto a uniform frequency grid of $N=86400\times 55$ points. At grid frequencies outside the range of $f_e$ values, the interpolated values of $\widetilde{Z}_{kx}$ and $\widetilde{Z}_{ky}$ were set to zero. 95\% confidence intervals were computed using bootstrap resampling: at each $f_e$, the $N_e$ pairs of $\widetilde{Z}_{kx}$ and $\widetilde{Z}_{ky}$ were randomly selected with replacement, and the sums in the $\text{SE}$ formula were computed using these randomly selected pairs. This process was repeated $1,000$ times, and the results were sorted in ascending order; the maximum $\text{SE}$ error bar value is the $975$th value in the sorted list, and the minimum is the $25$th. No confidence intervals were computed if $N_e\le 10$.

The squared coherence, $\text{Coh}^2_{XY}(f_e)$, was computed using the 

\begin{equation}
\text{Coh}^2_{XY}(f_e) = \frac{\left|\displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^{N_e}\widetilde{X}^*(f_j)\widetilde{Y}(f_j)\right|^2}{\displaystyle\sum_{j=1}^{N_e} \left|\widetilde{X}(f_j)\right|^2\sum_{j=1}^{N_e} \left|\widetilde{Y}(f_j)\right|^2}
\end{equation}

\noindent where the summation frequencies and $f_e$ values are the same as those used for computing the $\text{SE}$. 95\% error bars were computed using the same as $\text{SE}$. The coherence was computed between the predicted field, $E^\text{p}_k(t)$, and the measured field, $E_k(t)$, and also between $E_x^\text{p}(t)$ and $B_y(t)$ and between $E_y^\text{p}(t)$ and $B_x(t)$.

Traditionally, the primary quality metric used for evaluating the transfer function is the $\text{Coh}^2_{E_xB_y}$ and $\text{Coh}^2_{E_yB_x}$. Here, we have also computed the coherences between the measured and predicted fields, $\text{Coh}^2_{E_kE^\text{p}_k}$ ($k=x,y$), as it is a more direct measure of the ability of the transfer function to reproduce the signal. Coherence has a limitation, however. Two signals that are identical except for a scaling factor will have the same coherence for any scaling factor. As a result, we have introduced the signal--to--error, which can be used to make a more direct assessment of how well the transfer function captures the measured signal.

Note that $\text{SE}$ defined by Equation~\ref{eqn:se} differs in general from the signal--to--noise ratio, $\text{Coh}^2/(1-\text{Coh}^2)$ that applies only if the input signal and the noise in the output signal (which is unknown) are uncorrelated and the input signal has no noise (\cite{Miranda2006}; \cite{Pedersen1988}).

The signal-to-error and squared coherence associated with the transfer functions shown in Figure~\ref{fig:z} are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:se}. In the top panel of Figure~\ref{fig:se}(a), we see that the transfer function for $E_x$ only captures the variations in the data at periods longer than approximately 40 seconds, and that the model computed using one 55-day segment has a slightly higher $\text{SE}$ ratio. For $E_y$, the top panel of Figure~\ref{fig:se}(b) shows that the period range over which the transfer function produces useful predictions is from approximately 6 minutes to 6 hours.

\section{Comparison to KAP103}

\cite{Jones2009} presented a summary of an MT survey of sites in South Africa; the results of the transfer function calculations are available from ~\cite{Jones2004}. The transfer functions were computed using the Bounded Influence Remote Reference algorithm \cite{Chave2004}. The site nearest Middelpos is KAP103, which is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:map}.

In Figure~\ref{fig:timeseries-KAP103}, the 26--day magnetic and electric time series are shown along with the magnitude of their Fourier coefficients. The measurement interval included the large geomagnetic storm of November 20--22, 2003, that followed the October 31st ``Halloween" storm.

In Figure~\ref{fig:z-compare-KAP103}, we compare the pre--computed KAP103 transfer function (~\cite{Jones2004}) with that computed at Middelpos (corresponding to the ``1 55--day segment" lines shown in Figure~\ref{fig:z}). In addition, we have used the time series shown in Figure~\ref{fig:timeseries-KAP103} and the single transfer methodology described in the previous section.

There are several significant differences in the transfer functions shown in Figure~\ref{fig:z-compare-KAP103}. First, as in Figure~\ref{fig:z}, the method used to compute the transfer function can lead to statistically significant differences in the transfer functions (with respect to the computed error bars). In the case of the comparison of the BIRRP transfer functions with the single transfer function method used in the previous section, significant differences are found in all components of $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{\widetilde{Z}}}$, and these differences tend to occur at short and long periods.

Much larger differences exist between the amplitudes of the transfer functions computed at Middelpos and at KAP103, where the magnitudes of the Middelpos transfer function components range from 2 to 10 times smaller than those at KAP103. 

However, the transfer function phases are generally consistent, with the exception of $\widetilde{Z}_{yy}$.

To determine if the large geomagnetic storm may explain some of the differences, we have computed transfer functions using only data prior to November 20th and find consistent results, similar to \cite{Chen2022}, who found that for several of the SAMTEX sites, the computed transfer functions were not strongly dependent on whether the storm was included or not.

\section{Summary}

Transfer functions (surface impedances) were computed from magnetotelluric data collected at Middelpos, South Africa, over 55 days. We find that the computed transfer function depends on the method used to perform the regression. In one case, the full time range of data was split into 116 1-day segments, and the resulting 116 transfer functions were averaged in the frequency domain. In the other case, no splitting was performed, and a single transfer function was computed. At many frequencies, and for all components of the transfer function, differences were found that were inconsistent with the computed error bars. 

We also compared the transfer function at Middelpos with the nearest MT site from the SAMTEX campaign. The transfer function magnitudes differed significantly at all frequencies.
